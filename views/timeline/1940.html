    <p style="font-size:13px; margin-top:-34px; color:#6e6e6e;">As the strains of the Great Depression eased, a new challenge to the amusement industry reared its head in the form of World War II. In Europe, many parks, including the Prater in Vienna, Austria, and Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, Denmark, suffered extensive damage, while facilities in North America experienced a mixed impact. The booming wartime economy benefited the industry in manyareas as guests flocked to amusement parks to escape the troubled times. However, travel restrictions prompted many facilities in remote locations to shutter for the duration—in some cases, they never reopened. Once the hostilities ended, however, the industry rebounded strongly. Two decades of pent-up demand led to record levels of business and investment. New manufacturers entered theindustry, while others expanded their offerings.

        <p style="color:#696969; font-size:12px;"><strong>1941 |</strong>  As America was being drawn into the war, the industry was already showing strains with attendance dropping at the 1941 NAAPPB convention. The trade show withered as many manufacturers were already focusing production on wartime efforts.

        <p style="color:#696969; font-size:12px;"><strong>1942 |</strong>  In a Billboard article, NAAPPB’s Alfred Hodge described the value the industry could provide in wartime: “It has long since been proved that perhaps the finest antidote for fear is fun, and that is our business ... Fun is a gloom chaser; fun drives out discouragement and despair; fun pushes aside pessimism.” But the association also knew it was important to remain vigilant and advance industry interests in the face of travel restrictions, fuel rationing, and potentially punitive tax policies.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-p">
        In June, the NAAPPB surveyed members and found business was holding up despite travel restrictions (although personnel shortages were hampering operations). The board adopted a resolution imploring the government to ease gas restrictions.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-p">
        The annual convention went on as planned with the educational sessions focusing on “Victory Clinics,” emphasizing how facilities could best address the challenges of the war. However, the trade show was suspended since manufacturers were focused on producing products for the war effort, rather than amusement devices.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-p">
        To help offset the lack of spare parts and new equipment, NAAPPB positioned itself as a clearinghouse, taking stock among its members of surplus rides, parts, and equipment—deeming participation the “patriotic duty” of every operator.

        <p style="color:#696969; font-size:12px;"><strong>1943 |</strong>  NAAPPB worked closely with bureaus in Washington, D.C., to prove the industry’s value to morale and limit restrictions in pay levels and transportation.   </p>
          <p class="indent-p">The NAAPPB launched its “Guide and Manual.” Published in honor of the association’s 25th anniversary, it was a way to keep membersin touch with each other, informed about the goings on in the industry, and promote its suppliers. This was the launch of what later became the “Directory and Buyer’s Guide,” an important membership benefit for 60 years that today exists in digital form on IAAPA’s website.   </p>
            <p class="indent-p">In commenting on the success of the association on the advent of its 25th anniversary, President Leonard Schloss of Glen Echo Park, outside Washington, shared a sentiment that is just as relevant today: “To me, it is the bond of personal friendship and mutual confidencewhich has developed through the industry through the association. In the early days, men would attend the convention and look upon
        each other with suspicion as desperate competitors even though their parks or beaches might lie 1,000 miles apart. Soon after, however,men began to divulge their secrets of successful operations and to extend a willing hand of helpfulness on all sides. Thus, each convention became not only a period of good fellowship but, what is more important, an intensive training period for the latest and best practices in park, pool, and beach operation.”

        <p class="" style="color:#696969; font-size:12px;"><strong>1945 |</strong>  With the war ended, a new sense of optimism prevailed in the association. “We are entering a new era, and the same old methods will not suffice,” said Hodge and President Paul Hudepohl in the “Guide and Manual.” “Our industry has grown up. More is to be expected of us, and we will meet and shoulder our responsibilities only through increased unity, greater efficiency, and an ever-increasing search for improvements.</p><p class="indent-p">A “Postwar Previews” session at the convention featured manufacturers presenting new attractions that had been in development, but stalled due to wartime materials shortages.

        <p class="" style="color:#696969; font-size:12px;"><strong>1946 |</strong>  Alfred Hodge, the association’s first full-time employee, passed away on July 21. His 26-year tenure is noted as one of the longest of any secretary/executive director/president in association history. In an emergency meeting of the board, Paul Hudepohl was appointed the new secretary. Hudepohl had recently left his longtime job at Jantzen Beach in Portland, Oregon, and had served as NAAPPB’s president in 1945.</p><p class="indent-p">The trade show resumed at the convention. Space quickly sold out, and $500,000 in orders were placed despite material shortages still limiting production. Registration totaled 1,868, nearly five times the turnout two years earlier.</p><p class="indent-p">J.W. Shillian, managing director of the British Motorboat Manufacturing Co. (the show’s only European exhibitor) relayed that the UnitedKingdom was also experiencing raw materials shortages, limiting new attractions. He stated that attractions on the west coast of the United Kingdom escaped damage, while those on the east coast were hard hit and having trouble rebuilding. He also mentioned parks in Holland, Belgium, Sweden, and Denmark were operating, but short of money and equipment.
