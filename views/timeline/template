Roller coasters emerged as the king of the park, with drops and twists that were unimaginable just a few years before. The emergence of the automobile impacted the industry, closing dozens of parks that lacked accessibility androom for parking lots and were replaced by newer, more modern amusement parks. Swimming pools became a popular attraction at dozens of amusement parks
