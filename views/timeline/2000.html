    <p style="font-size:13px; margin-top:-34px; color:#6e6e6e;">As the industry moved into a new century, it was full of changes, challenges, and opportunities. Industry consolidation continued as financiers became major industry players. Increasing real estate values, the maturation of the family entertainment center sector, and financial problems of several operators led to a wave of park closings. This included nearly two dozen seaside amusement parks in the United States and England, along with major facilities in Australia, Europe, and Japan.</p><p class="indent-p">But there were still many positive aspects of the decade. After two decades of failed attempts by other operators, the attractions industry started to take root in emerging markets like China and the Middle East. While the latest roller coaster arms race ended, technology started to play an increasing role as suppliers and facilities started developing attractions that provided a more complete experience

Drew Exposition brought the Seattle Wheel, a unique Ferris wheel built by Chance Rides in 1962 for the Seattle World’s Fair, to the IAAPA trade show in Atlanta. Rides were offered for $2 each with proceeds going to Make-A-Wish and Give Kids The World.</p><p class="indent-p"> The trade show ambassador program was launched with 21 students assisting in the operation of the convention. The program stemmed from IAAPA’s participation in a course at George Washington University in 1999 that sent colleges to professional conferences to record and write summaries of education sessions.

        <p style="color:#696969; font-size:12px;"><strong>2001 |</strong>  IAAPA introduced its current logo, reflecting a more global association.</p><p class="indent-p">Following the announced retirement of longtime President and CEO John Graff, IAAPA launched a transition process that began in May with the hiring of trade association executive Bret Lovejoy as incoming president. Graff remained on the job through 2001 to ease in the transition.</p><p class="indent-p">The first international office opened in Brussels on Aug. 1. With 800 members, Europe represented the largest international region for the organization. Jeff Bertus, head of the European parks association Europarks, was named IAAPA Vice President, Europe.</p><p class="indent-p">The lobbying firm Williams & Jensen was hired to make the industry a more visible presence in the U.S. capital.</p><p class="indent-p">Following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, the Summer Meeting at Cedar Point was canceled. While a record 400 were expected, about 30 made it to the park, along with a handful of IAAPA staffers, and they were treated to special tours and social events courtesy of Cedar Point.

        <p style="color:#696969; font-size:12px;"><strong>2002 |</strong>  Bret Lovejoy tendered his resignation effective June 28, and the board appointed industry veteran Clark Robinson as interim president. Robinson spent much of his career at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah, served as IAAPA president in 1981, and served on numerous board and committee positions. Robinson initially took over for six months, but ended up staying three and a half years as his appointment was made permanent in November.</p><p class="indent-p">IAAPA’s global profile grew throughout the year. The World Council held its first dedicated meeting in Brussels; IAAPA Europe hostedits first official seminar at Efteling in Kaatsheuvel, Netherlands; and Ashok Goel was appointed to the IAAPA Board of Directors, the first director from India. The organization also won a seat on London-based World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC).</p><p class="indent-p">John Graff remained with the association in the role of director of the charities program to direct efforts to support three organizations—Give Kids The World and two new additions, UNICEF and the International Institute for Peace Through Tourism.

        <p style="color:#696969; font-size:12px;"><strong>2003 |</strong>  A brain injury study commissioned by Six Flags Inc. and supported by IAAPA was released. Conducted by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and Exponent Failure Analysis Associates, it refuted media and political claims linking thrill rides to brain injuries. A separate report by the Brain Injury Association of America’s Blue-Ribbon Panel, which was convened at the requestof U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, an advocate of increased federal oversight of the industry, came to the same conclusion. It went so far as to state: “It is unlikely that any federal agency could match the amusement park industry’s self-monitoring.”</p><p class="indent-p">The industry’s commitment to safety grew as IAAPA introduced an incident reporting database and launched the International Standards Harmonization Group to bring consistency to safety standards throughout the world.</p><p class="indent-p">IAAPA acquired the 12-year-old Asian Amusement Exposition from co-owners Terrapinn Pte. Ltd. and the American Amusement Machine Association. IAAPA was a longtime supporter of the show, and the purchase permitted the association to add an educational component. Unfortunately, the 2003 show ended up being canceled due to the SARS virus that spread through southern Asia.
        </p><p class="indent-p"> The IAAPA trade show moved into the new North/South building at the Orange County Convention Center and was the first major Expo in the facility. It has become the long-term home to the conference and trade show, held there all but three times since. In addition, the IAAPA Bookstore debuted at the convention.</p><p class="indent-p">The annual charity golf tournament teed off in support of Give Kids The World, the first of several events that are now held to support the charity during IAAPA Attractions Expo week.
