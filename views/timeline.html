<p style="font-size:13px; margin-top:-34px;">As IAAPA celebrates its centennial, the association is part of the attractions industry's rich global legacy stretching back more than 500 years. The industry’s roots come from the pleasure gardens that spread throughout European cities from the 1500s to the early 1800s. They provided a place to escape teeming cities and featured many attractions familiar to us today, including landscaped gardens, live entertainment, fireworks, dancing, games, and even predecessors to the merry-go-round, roller coaster, and Ferris wheel. This legacy remains in places like Bakken, outside Copenhagen, Denmark, which opened in 1583, and the Prater in Vienna, which dates back to 1766; Mack Rides, meanwhile, started manufacturing show wagons in 1780.

<br><br>
 Pleasure gardens migrated to North America in the late 1700s, but it was not until the latter half of the 1800s that amusement parks began to truly emerge as their own industry. In the years following the American Civil War, transportation companies began developing pleasure resorts to generate traffic. The trolley park was born with the development of the first successful electric street railway, and amusement parks spread rapidly through the United States. Seaside resorts offering more extended getaways opened throughout the United States and England. Chicago’s World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893 and the emergence of Coney Island in New York as the center of the amusement park universe brought global attention to this emerging sector. With new parks opening worldwide at a rapid clip, companies began forming to supply equipment to these new operations. It was obvious a new industry was emerging, and its members needed to speak with one voice
