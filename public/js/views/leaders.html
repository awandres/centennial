  Andrew S. McSwigan</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">IAAPA Founding Father</h4>
      <div class="p-div-right-2 pdr-2-content" style="">

        <p style="">In 1918, the National Outdoor Showmen’s Association (NOSA) formed a Parks Division within its organization to bring in amusement park representatives. It was the first national group in the United States for amusement park operators and is credited as the foundation of what we now know as IAAPA.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">By 1920, general membership in NOSA had decreased, and it became evident the amusement park segment was carrying most of the responsibility, financially and otherwise. Two months prior to the NOSA annual meeting in 1920, Kennywood’s president, Andrew S. McSwigan, called several of the top amusement park officials in the country to Pittsburgh to discuss the creation of a new organization devoted completely to protecting and advancing the best interests of America’s 1,500 amusement parks.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;"> Two months later in Chicago, this same group of men, along with others, convened for the NOSA meeting and voted to merge NOSA with the larger amusement park delegation to create a more park-oriented association. It was named the National Association of Amusement Parks (NAAP), and following several different names, that group became IAAPA in 1973.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">McSwigan was elected president and subsequently served four terms. He was the epitome of what the NAAP stood for and worked tirelessly to gain public respect for all parks. McSwigan promoted that all parks should be run in a clean and moral manner. He and his initial board built the new association on five basics: to monitor and influence all legislation; help the industry with insurance problems and other related challenges; encourage and cultivate relationships with other outdoor entertainment businesses and promote mutual concerns; promote safety within parks; and to provide a platform for the presentation of papers on various topics, including advertising and promotional ideas, group business protocol, and insurance issues.  </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">The association made an immediate impact. Within a year, the dominant journalistic voice of the industry, The Billboard magazine, wrote NAAP had “developed into quite a healthy organization, a factor to be reckoned with. Much has been accomplished in this short space of time and greater things can be expected of the organization as the years roll by.” After praising McSwigan and the other board members, the magazine noted that as NAAP carries out its purposes, “parkdom will have much to be thankful for.”
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">McSwigan died suddenly in 1923 while still dedicating much of his time for the association that he helped create. He founded a practical business association for the amusement park industry, dedicated to cooperation, mutual welfare, educational objectives, and protection against unjust taxes and legislation. These goals remain paramount during the association’s 100th year.

  Leonard Thompson</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">Leading IAAPA Advocate from Europe</h4>
      <div class="p-div-2 pd2-content" style="">

        <p style="">Leonard Thompson found himself running one of the world’s great seaside amusement parks at age 25 and went on to gain the reputation of father figure of the attractions industry in England.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">The son-in-law of Blackpool Pleasure Beach’s founding father, W.G. Bean, Thompson took over the park when Bean died in 1929. From across the Atlantic Ocean, Thompson saw the advantages of an IAAPA membership and joined the organization as the first non-North American park. One year later, he helped start the British park association, BALPPA; he later served as that group’s president in1974.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">With degrees from the University of Oxford (where he was a Rhodes Scholar), Thompson brought a wealth of expertise to the attractions industry, in both financial and economic areas. He brought contemporary methods of advertising, engineering, and architecture to Blackpool Pleasure Beach over the course of 50 years, creating a model for other facilities to follow.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">During WWII, when many forms of British entertainment were severely restricted, Thompson worked to keep the park open as a safe place of amusement, away from the ravages and realities of war. Blackpool Pleasure Beach became a beacon of hope, serving as a destination for military personnel, including American servicemen.  </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Thompson traveled to the United States often to visit American parks and meet with ride manufacturers. Annual IAAPA conventions provided ideas for new attractions that helped fortify his facility as a dominant purveyor of fun in Northwest England. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Thompson’s ability to know what the public wanted next, along with a keen eye on finances, helped him modernize his park. He conceived the first ice show in Great Britain at Blackpool, entertainment which is still featured today as the longest-running ice show in the country.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Thompson stayed involved with IAAPA by serving on committees until a few years prior to his death in 1976. He was inducted into the IAAPA Hall of Fame in 1991.

  Alfred R. Hodge</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">First IAAPA Employee</h4>
      <div class="p-div-right-2 pdr-2-content" style="">

        <p style="">IAAPA as it is today is certainly attributable to many people who have touched the association in many different ways during the past 100 years. Alfred Hodge is a name most members don’t know, but he is one of the most important park executives in our history. He got us going in the right direction, right from the beginning.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Hodge was appointed secretary of the NAAP, the forerunner of IAAPA, at its organizational meeting on Feb. 17, 1920, making him the first staff member of what was to become the world’s largest attractions industry association. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">He served the association for 26 years until his death in July 1946, making him also the longest tenured secretary/executive director/president in the organization’s history. During his years, his innovative and creative style was put to the test many times as he worked tirelessly to build the association. Hodge oversaw the tentative early years, guided it through a transformational merger (with the American Association of Pools and Beaches), and successfully managed through two of the most difficult periods in industry history—the Great Depression and World War II.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Hodge came to the association after serving as the publicity and advertising chief at Chicago’s Riverview Park for eight years. He organized the association’s first trade show held at the annual meeting in Chicago in 1921, with 45 exhibitors. He was one of the first,if not the first, to see the true value of membership in the association, and his hope was to see every park join as a member, uniting the strength of many to the benefit of all. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Hodge worked to create a viable association that non-members felt was essential to join, for their own betterment. He campaigned for better fire and liability insurance plans, more constructive programs, and more intense educational sessions at the conventions. He strove to make the amusement industry a symbol for recreation of the highest order. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Despite the challenges of having no roadmap to follow during those early years, Hodge used his instincts and talents to grow membership and increase services, laying the groundwork for what we enjoy today as members of IAAPA.

  Carl Hughes</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">First ‘Living Legend’ Inducted into IAAPA Hall of Fame</h4>
      <div class="p-div-2 pd2-content" style="">

        <p style="">The first “Living Legend” inducted into the IAAPA Hall of Fame, Carl Hughes, was also the first to cross many of the industry’s thresholds. He learned most of what he knew from on-the-job training. Hughes was 23 years old before he stepped into an amusement park for the first time; later, he earned respect in an era where prominence traditionally came from clout based on your family’s position in the industry.  </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Hughes was a sports reporter for the Pittsburgh Press, but following an offer he couldn’t refuse, he joined Kennywood in May 1956. Eventually, he worked his way up to become president of the famed Pennsylvania park, and then worked his way to the top of the association, as well.  </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">He was the first non-owner to hold a major office in the association when, in 1974, he was elected IAAPA President (now chairman). Hughes is widely recognized as the catalyst for changing the association into today’s professionally run organization. One of his goals was to bring more “international” participation into IAAPA, as there was not a great deal of involvement outside the United States when Hughes first joined the association.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">The first IAAPA convention held outside Chicago was in 1974, the year Hughes held the gavel. Moving the show was a huge decision—and a huge risk—for IAAPA at the time. But it proved to be a good move. Attendance was up, thanks to expanded exhibitionspace and additional conference offerings, such as educational seminars. There has not been a show in Chicago since that time. Membership increased 18 percent during Hughes’ term as president, thanks mostly to the international members he recruited.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Hughes’ humor and wit were a big part of his personality. In 1990, as he accepted his IAAPA Hall of Fame Award, his response from the stage, brought the house down with laughter: “Being a living legend is great. It sure beats the other category!”

  Bob Blundred</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">Executive Secretary, 1964-1983</h4>
      <div class="p-div-right-2 pdr-2-content" style="">

        <p style="">A chance meeting changed the direction of Bob Blundred’s life—and IAAPA history.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Blundred enjoyed his role as CEO of the Screen Process Printing Association in Chicago, where he organized the group’s annual convention at the Sherman House. That is, until he met the “amusement park guys” who also met at the fabled hotel. The group was searching for a new leader, and it didn’t take long for Blundred to join what he called “the handshake industry, a happy industry.”</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Blundred served IAAPA as executive secretary from 1964 to 1983, a period in which the amusement park industry saw some of the biggest changes during the 20th century. His job was to make sure the association adapted to all those changes. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">As a longtime association executive, Blundred knew a fresh perspective was needed, and he wasted no time setting up an office that could do two things for IAAPA members: help them make more money and show them how to save more money. Blundred said inall his years, those two things were paramount in virtually everything he and his staff did from a service perspective.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Blundred felt responsible for moving the industry forward through the association. His first goal was to evolve the conventions from a fun “good-old-boys” party to more of a business convention, with an emphasis on professional development and education. He expanded the small trade show, which mostly consisted of ride manufacturers, to include all products needed by parks. The trade show also moved out of Chicago, providing more exhibit space and a whole new world of opportunities for all attendees.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Blundred’s guiding hand also brought safety to the forefront of discussions, planning, and operations. Advertising and marketing, food products, recreational priorities, and household incomes were all major societal changes that affected day-to-day operation of both parks and the association during the 19 years he served as executive secretary. With foresight, good judgment, and a strong staff and board members, Blundred set the standard for association leadership and established a solid path for IAAPA to follow.

  John Graff</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">Longstanding IAAPA Leader</h4>
      <div class="p-div-2 pd2-content" style=" ">

        <p style="">By transcending the barriers of language and culture to expand the influence of the association worldwide, John Graff changed the global landscape of the attractions industry. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">During his legendary 20 years of service with IAAPA, Graff transformed the mostly United States-based organization of the early 1980s into a respected global association. Graff served as the force that not only brought the worldwide industry together, but helped change the image of the industry through his work within the association.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Graff served as the global ambassador, the face of IAAPA, and helped foster a sense of fraternity among the association’s membership. He helped create the framework that has assisted with government relations, while giving new wings to the industry by developing structure and programming to meet growing needs. During his tenure, Graff visited more than 400 facilities in 60 countries.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">
        He began his career at IAAPA as director of government relations and legal counsel in the summer of 1980, following six years as an attorney with Marriott. Graff opened IAAPA’s first office in Washington, D.C., and began building a government relations program. Within four years, when IAAPA’s then executive director, Bob Blundred, retired, Graff was tapped to lead the organization, only the fifth person in IAAPA history to hold the executive director position.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;"> In 1985, Graff moved IAAPA’s offices from Chicago to Washington, and shortly after, he oversaw the development of a series of strategic plans that would chart the course for the organization.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;"> That first strategic plan called for greater representation of members located outside the United States, encouraging their participation on association boards and committees. An international council was set up as a forum for those members, which was assigned three seats on the IAAPA Board of Directors—one from each of three geographical regions. In addition, Graff pursued the production of multilingual materials, participated in other trade exhibitions in Europe and Asia, and opened the first international IAAPA office in Europe in 2001.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Graff retired on Dec. 31, 2001, a month after his induction into the IAAPA Hall of Fame, but remains active with the association, particularly in its relationship with Give Kids The World

  Bo Kinntorph</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">First IAAPA Chairman from Outside the U.S.</h4>
      <div class="p-div-right-2 pdr-2-content" style="">

        <p style="">If you’re looking for a park executive as a primary motivating force in uniting the global theme park industry, the charismatic Swede, Bo Kinntorph, fits the bill. In 1992, while holding down the top executive post at Liseberg in Gothenburg, Sweden, he also served as the first non-American president (now known as chairman of the board) of IAAPA.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Even before he became an IAAPA board member and officer, Kinntorph was a global cheerleader for the association, using a combination of his outgoing personality, his keen business sense, and his uncanny ability to work with different cultures worldwide. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">As president of IAAPA, Kinntorph’s platform was to share how productive membership in IAAPA could be and to guarantee smaller parks and attractions around the world would receive the full benefit of membership. To Kinntorph, who discovered IAAPA shortly after joining Liseberg in 1973, the association was the glue needed to bring all Earth’s parks and attractions together. This mantra was something he believed would make everyone stronger, more competitive, and, eventually, more profitable.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Kinntorph invested a great deal of energy convincing global park officials to place trust in their membership and to become active in “their” association. His passion for IAAPA grew after attending a few conventions. He was drawn to the association as it provided much ofwhat he was looking for as a newcomer to the industry: well-organized workshops and a big, wide-ranging trade show.  </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">IAAPA had no presence in Sweden in 1973 when Kinntorph took over Liseberg, but once he discovered the association, he soon became a major player. Within 20 years of his first involvement, he became its first president from outside the United States.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">During his presidency, he was instrumental in creating two notable education programs: the development of the annual weeklong Institute for Industry Management held at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and the On-Site Training Program. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">
        Kinntorph was inducted into the IAAPA Hall of Fame in 1996, three years after his retirement. Yet, he continued to serve IAAPA by assisting with the IAAPA Strategic Plans in 2003 and 2004.

  Bill Alter</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">Instrumental in Shaping IAAPA Attractions Expo</h4>
      <div class="p-div-2 pd2-content" style="">

        <p style="">Bill Alter spent his entire working career of 47 years with National Ticket Company, and of all the various industries he worked with during his years selling tickets, he chose to be active in only IAAPA. He was drawn to the attractions industry because the owners and operators “were sincere in truly wanting to see families have fun.”</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Alter attended his first IAAPA trade show at Chicago’s Sherman House in 1963 and served two terms on the IAAPA Board of Directors. As an industry supplier, Alter’s role on the board during his first term was strictly that of a non-voting adviser. In 1989, he was the first supplier to be put on the IAAPA Strategic Planning Committee, and during his last period as a board member in 1994, he was asked to helpcreate and then chair the IAAPA Manufacturers and Suppliers (M&S) Committee, which he headed up for five years. The chair of the M&S committee also serves on the IAAPA Attractions Expo Space Allocation Committee, a position he held for 20 years. Alter is recognized as the person instrumental in helping shape the Expo as we now know it; through analysis and positive critique, the work of the M&S and the space allocation committees over the years made the trade show easier (and more profitable) for exhibitors.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">The IAAPA Board of Directors, through the creation of the M&S committee, made a commitment to work more closely with manufacturers and suppliers. This transformed IAAPA into a more responsive organization, as it was the first time M&S members had direct input into the trade show decision-making process. Alter and his committee provided valuable input into everything from deciding which city would host the Expo to the design of the attendee badges. It wasn’t easy at the beginning, but the M&S committee worked hard and proved to be highly beneficial to the association.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Alter’s legacy goes beyond being a supplier. He was one of the earliest advocates for the partnership between the association and Give Kids The World, dedicating endless hours to fundraising activities to support the charity and its mission to help children with life-threatening illnesses. He continues to play a key role in the association’s GKTW activities today.

  Ted Crowell</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">IAAPA’s Initial Link to Give Kids The World</h4>
      <div class="p-div-right-2 pdr-2-content" style="">

        <p style="">More than 150,000 families around the world continue to feel the lasting impact of Ted Crowell’s legacy, brightening lives and inspiring hope. As a Disney Parks cast member, Crowell helped create the magic felt at theme parks. As a supporter of Give Kids The World (GKTW), Crowell shared that passion with an entire industry.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Before Crowell was elected to the third chair on the IAAPA Board of Directors in 1992, no Disney Parks official had ever been involved to the same level with IAAPA. He started at Disneyland as an engineer who is remembered for his work on queues. Today, his designs of effectively managing a large amount of people in small spaces are part of attractions worldwide.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">When Crowell officially retired from a 34-year career with Disney in 1992, the company retained him as a full-time official IAAPA representative. Three years later, Crowell became IAAPA president (now chairman). He jumped in with both time and spirit, transferring his energy and dedication from Disney to IAAPA.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Known for his ability to find and solve problems as an engineer, Crowell soon became a valuable asset to the IAAPA board. He worked diligently with his fellow directors to create IAAPA’s third strategic plan; when he became president, he used that plan as a blueprint for his priorities.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Crowell acknowledged one accomplishment that gave him great satisfaction during his presidency was the implementation of a training program for newly elected board members, which resulted in more effective participation. Five new committees were created under his watch, and he actively recruited past IAAPA presidents and board members as chairs of those committees to help give them immediate direction and purpose. Yet, his warm helping hand didn’t end there.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Many consider Crowell’s most remarkable contribution to the association is IAAPA’s deep and lasting relationship with one of his favorite charities, Give Kids The World (GKTW). The 84-acre storybook resort in Kissimmee, Florida, hosts children with life-threatening illnesses and their families for weeklong, cost-free vacations. Through Crowell’s encouragement, IAAPA adopted GKTW as its official charity in November 1994.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">One of the first projects Crowell created ensured the magic found at GKTW would be felt across the industry. The World Passport for Kids program brings together IAAPA member facilities that agree to admit GKTW children and their families for a day of fun, after they return home from Orlando. This extension of their vacation helps them take the magic of GKTW home.

  Gina Romano</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">IAAPA’s First Female President</h4>
      <div class="p-div-2 pd2-content" style="">

        <p style="">The first woman to hold the president’s (now chair’s) gavel of IAAPA grew up working virtually every job at her family-owned Nellie Bly Amusement Park in Brooklyn, New York. After an early life spent working in ride operations, food service, grounds maintenance, and marketing, Gina Romano became the park’s general manager in 1986. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Romano also holds the distinction of becoming the first president of IAAPA hailing from a small park (less than 3 acres in size, with fewer than 150,000 annual admissions). She brought the perspective of a small park operator, enabling her to understand the needs of small facilities worldwide. Romano was successful in connecting small parks and family entertainment centers (FECs) with much larger members of the association, fostering an environment in which all could learn from one another. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">In 1997, with the internet and digital communications becoming a greater tool for the business, one of Romano’s top priorities as president was the creation a compelling IAAPA website. She believed the new site should address all members, no matter where they lived in the world.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Romano will go down in history as the first female president. Structure changes made at the board level in 1997 led to the top board member retaining the title of “chairman,” thus, Romano is also the last elected “president” of IAAPA. She oversaw the structural change, which named the full-time head of the association president and CEO (a position formerly called “executive director”). The change came from the belief that the elected officials should not be involved in the day-to-day operation of IAAPA, but rather represent the organization to members and create strategic planning.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">As the first female president, one of the issues dear to Romano’s heart was motivating more women to become involved in leadership roles. She led the way in showing how women should be a part of a growing international organization, no matter the size of their businesses.

  Rene Aziz</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">First IAAPA Chairman from Latin America</h4>
      <div class="p-div-right-2 pdr-2-content" style="">

        <p style="">Rene Aziz opened his first park in 1983 with only one ride. Three years later, he joined IAAPA, knowing few park operators outside of Mexico. By the time he was elected IAAPA Chairman of the Board in 2000, he was overseeing operations at six facilities in Mexico and one in Colombia, along with owning his own company, Grupo Magico Internacional. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">While Aziz worked within various committees during his rise to the top of the association, he realized how the foundation IAAPA provided him allowed for continual growth. His goal became to create programs that would be attractive to all operators around the globe.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Aziz received an invitation to join the IAAPA Board of Directors in 1989. He served on several committees, including a stint as the chairman of the IAAPA International Council in 1995. As that group’s leader, he was instrumental in the creation of IAAPA “embassies”representing nine different geographical and cultural regions of the world. The establishment of international representatives is remembered as a leap forward in changing membership composition to reflect the global attractions industry.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">In 1996, he was elected third vice chairman, a move that signaled the path to become the association’s first Latin American leader in its then 82-year history. During his service, the association founded a crisis communications task force of worldwide industry leaders to create a proactive media relations plan for all members.  </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Aziz was instrumental in using government statistics to create a white paper outlining the industry’s safety record. For the first time, all IAAPA members were on the same page and could use the document, “Safety in the Amusement Industry: Serious Business in the United States,” as a tool when educating the press and public on the industry’s safety record.

  Jane Cooper</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">An Eclectic IAAPA Chair</h4>
      <div class="p-div-2 pd2-content" style="">

        <p style="">Jane Cooper has been there, done that. She started in the industry as a 17-year-old seasonal employee selling souvenirs at Kings Island in Ohio. She worked her way through various jobs at several parks and eventually became president and CEO of Paramount Parks in 1995. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">She was the first frontline employee at the Kings Entertainment Company/Paramount Parks group to reach the top rung, the company’s first female president. By the time she left Paramount in 2002, she had been involved with IAAPA for nearly a decade and became the association’s chair of the board in 2005. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Cooper was also a founding member of the IAAPA Foundation in 2010. When the IAAPA Board of Directors refocused the foundation’s priorities in 2016, Cooper was chosen as its chair. The foundation’s purpose is “to inspire life-changing careers in the global attractions industry by cultivating tomorrow’s leaders.” </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">
        It is Cooper’s continued dedication to young people and the betterment of the association that has earned her a stellar reputation. She’s served on numerous committees and, during her term as chair, made outreaches to a global array of other attractions industry associations to create beneficial alliances with IAAPA. Through her global influence and dedication to both the association and the attractions industry, Cooper continues to be one of the great ambassadors for IAAPA.

  Bob Masterson</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">First IAAPA Chairman from a Small Attraction</h4>
      <div class="p-div-right-2 pdr-2-content" style="">

        <p style="">Bob Masterson took a collection of small museums filled with oddities, and within two decades built an attraction chain respected around the world. Masterson worked at Ripley Entertainment for 36 years, the last 20 as its president. During that time, visitation grew to more than 13 million visitors a year. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">By the time Masterson retired in 2008, he had built the brand to 73 businesses in 13 countries. With that proven business acumen, when Masterson spoke, people listened. The success garnered the attention of other smaller attractions around the world. As a board member and officer of IAAPA, Masterson’s message was clear: small operators worldwide could be successful, as well—especially if they joined IAAPA and used the organization’s resources and benefits to the fullest. Masterson generated much attention and respect for the small attraction industry within IAAPA. </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Masterson joined Ripley in 1973, attended his first IAAPA event in the late ’70s, became Ripley president in 1989, joined the IAAPA Board of Directors in 2005, and in 2008 became the first IAAPA chairman to come from the small attractions side of the industry.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">During his many years serving on various IAAPA committees, and during his ascension from third vice chairman to chairman, Masterson’s quirky, forthright persona and keen business sense kept everyone on their toes. While Masterson was a fair executive, he earned the reputation for stirring things up and encouraging others to think differently.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">His “be creative” message spread to other small attractions around the world during his chairmanship. Masterson had a reputation of putting an emphasis on the last “A” (attractions) in IAAPA. He recruited attractions, zoos, FECs, and other smaller operators into the association and onto its various committees. He recognized future growth of the organization would come from smaller facilities in theUnited States and from new attractions in the Asian market.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Masterson’s accomplishments included the recruitment of new Asian members, both to the association and to its committees and boards. He worked diligently to clarify the various membership categories and the dues structures of each to better allow smaller and non-American facilities to afford membership. As a world traveler, he served as an IAAPA ambassador, making a point to share the value of being part of the association wherever he went.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">  Masterson and P.T. Barnum, another larger-than-life entertainment industry titan, were both elected into the IAAPA Hall of Fame in 2012.

  Chip Cleary</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">The Only IAAPA President and Chairman</h4>
      <div class="p-div-2 pd2-content" style="">

        <p style="">James “Chip” Cleary enjoyed his time as IAAPA Chairman of the Board so much, he decided to stay longer. The year after Cleary ended his term as chairman, he was hired as IAAPA President and CEO—the only person in the organization’s 100-year history to hold both posts. By all accounts, he is credited with upgrading the association’s technology, bringing in a new intellectual property program, and revamping IAAPA’s budget and expense-management processes.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Cleary joined the industry full time in 1978 at Adventureland Amusement Park in Farmingdale, New York. He attended his first IAAPA convention and trade show the following fall in Atlanta. While in Georgia, he became involved in committee work, serving on and chairing numerous committees and board positions over the years.  </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Cleary went on to manage a variety of attractions, including amusement parks, family entertainment centers, and water parks.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">In 2007, he was elected third vice chairman and began his ascension to the chairman’s position, which he held during 2010. In April 2011, five months after his chairmanship ended, Cleary joined the IAAPA team full time. During the year of his chairmanship, Cleary’s main focus was implementing the strategic plan he had helped create. During this period of strong association growth, Cleary felt it was important to stay true to a balanced plan. As president, Cleary gained a reputation for questioning everything from standing IAAPA policies to reexamining every budget item. Under his watchful eye, many changes led to strengthening IAAPA for the future.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Cleary specified when he became president and CEO that it would be a “bridge,” while a search continued for a career CEO to lead IAAPA. He said from the beginning that he would stay in the role for two years at the most. Feeling the work he set out to do was finished and had strong momentum, Cleary stepped aside at the end of 2012 ...and rejoined the IAAPA Board of Directors in 2018.

  Mario Mamon</h3>
        <h4 style="color:#696969;">First IAAPA Chairman from Asia-Pacific</h4>
      <div class="p-div-right-2 pdr-2-content" style="">

        <p style="">Mario Mamon and his family were making plans to build their own theme park in the Philippines when they realized they needed help.In his own words, “We didn’t know where to start,” Mamon recalls. Six months later, Mamon was on a plane bound for the IAAPA convention and trade show in Dallas. He became an association member in 1993; within a few short years, he was elected to the board of directors, serving from 1999 to 2002, and IAAPA chairman in 2014.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">With knowledge learned from IAAPA trade shows and seminars, along with contacts Mamon made through association networking, he was able to properly conceptualize and oversee the construction of his park, Enchanted Kingdom, which opened in 1995. He became the park’s president and CEO in 1999.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">From the beginning, Mamon was an active volunteer for IAAPA, appearing as a speaker at several association events in the Asia-Pacific region. Joining committees came quickly after—everything from membership and trade show advisory, to awards and governance committees. A dedicated believer in IAAPA, Mamon quickly proved how a membership could inspire personal and professional growth. He was part of a core group that created an attractions industry federation in Southeast Asia in 2005; the following year, he spearheaded the formation of a national association in the Philippines, of which he later became president.
        </p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">In 2011, Mamon was re-elected to the IAAPA Board of Directors and subsequently tagged as a future chairman—the association’s first from Asia-Pacific. Serving IAAPA on a global level during the first year of a new strategic plan aligned with his goal to promote more membership from his part of the world. The example convinced other Asian industry leaders to be more active in the association.</p><p style="margin-top:-3px;">Serving as IAAPA chairman in 2014 was a payback for Mamon “to an organization that has given me a new direction in life and a new industry to believe in and live by.” From a sugar-cane farmer to the head of his country’s world-class theme park—IAAPA helped provide the way.
