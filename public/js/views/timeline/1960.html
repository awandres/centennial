    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-top:-34px; color:#696969;">By the 1960s, the attractions industry was in the throes of a radical change. The opening of Six Flags Over Texas in 1961 proved the viability of the regional theme park, and soon the concept spread throughout the United States. New genres such as marine-life parks, studio tours, and early water parks were added to the mix. While it was a quiet decade among amusement parks outside the United States, the European ride manufacturers were changing the industry. Their colorful, flashy rides—Himalayas, Bayern Kurves, Giant Ferris wheel, and a new generation of portable steel roller coasters—were in great demand and played a critical role in the emerging globalization of the industry as they were sought after by facility operators throughout the world.

Fowler’s addition marked the first full-time themepark representation added to the board. Fowler joined IAAPA a year after President Truman appointed him to reduce wasteful military spending. Fowler would go on to chair the safety committee for several years.</p><p class="indent-p"> A new feature at the convention was an Under 40 Brunch. Programming focused on younger employees in the industry was a fixture for the next several years and foreshadowed today’s Young Professionals network within the association.

Members were asked to contribute one 10th of 1 percent of their gross revenues to finance the campaign. A total of $45,000 was raised. The strategy involved increasing exposure of amusement parks and elevating the perception of the industry via two themes: “Family Fun For Everyone” and “100 Days of Fun.”</p><p class="indent-p">With increasing demand for exhibit space, a lower-level hall at the Sherman House was used for the first time, making room for 30 additional booths. Kiddieland operators opened a hospitality center at the event—Kiddie Korner.

A career trade association executive, Blundred came to IAAP from the Music Operators of America and replaced John Bowman, who resigned in 1963 to take a job at a New York-based public relations firm.</p><p class="indent-p">At an April meeting in Cincinnati, the separate kiddieland group decided to disband and let IAAP assume its duties. The group felt it had long outgrown the kiddieland designation and that its focus was more on smaller operators. It vowed to work with IAAP to ensure relevant programming was added to the convention.</p><p class="indent-p"> IAAP’s board began to reflect changes in the industry. Joining Truman Woodworth of Disneyland, who took Joe Fowler’s spot on the board, were Charles Thompson of Six Flags Over Texas and E.R. (Doc) Lemmon of Cedar Point.</p><p class="indent-p"> Some attendees began to think that Chicago was no longer an optimal location for a convention. In a letter to Amusement Business, Kenneth Wynne of Casino Pier in New Jersey cited the weather and the ability for manufacturers to demonstrate their products in operating conditions in a warmer climate as primary reasons to move to a warmer climate.

        <p class="" style="color:#696969; font-size:14px;"><strong>1966 |</strong>  The International Association of Fairs and Expositions (IAFE), which held its convention concurrently in Chicago with IAAP since the 1930s and attended IAAP’s trade show, considered splitting off and holding its own convention and trade show at the same time in another city. IAFE cited challenges with the aging Sherman House and a lack of revenue opportunities. After lengthy negotiations, the organizations agreed to continue holding their conventions concurrently in Chicago for four years. A $25 increase in the booth rental fee would be split between the IAFE and Showmen’s League of America.</p><p class="indent-p">The controversy resulted in reduced attendance at the convention, with just $2.5 million in orders booked, less than the amount from the year before. Approximately $1.8 million was booked by Chance, driven by its Skydiver and Rotor rides.</p><p class="indent-p">IAAP distributed promotion kits to its members containing print ad templates that could be customized by each facility, saving engraving costs. It also distributed a promotion scrapbook—a binder containing best practices in various promotional activities such as price promotions, picnic advertising, and brochures
