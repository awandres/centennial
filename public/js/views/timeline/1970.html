    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-top:-34px; color:#696969;">As the 1970s dawned, the industry was vastly different than the one that existed just a decade before. Since the early 1900s, large inner-city amusement parks, in most cases owned by families, dominated the industry. Those attractions included places such as Chicago’s Riverview, Cleveland’s Euclid Beach, Coney Island’s Steeplechase, New Jersey’s Palisades, and Fontaine Ferry in Louisville, Kentucky. But at this time, most were closing throughout the United States. They were victims of rising property values, urban decay and unrest, aging facilities, and ownership succession challenges. As the facilities closed, the families who were once the leaders of the industry also exited, creating openings for a new generation of leaders. New facilities such as Walt Disney World in Orlando, Kings Island in Cincinnati, Ohio, Magic Mountain near Los Angeles, and Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, became the new industry anchors. Theme parks began to spread around the globe with the debut of places like Europa-Park and the Walibi chain in Europe, Ocean Park in Asia, and Dreamworld in Australia. And as theme parks spread, they rediscovered the timeless appeal of the roller coaster, and the industry found itself in the throes of a roller coaster arms race not seen since the 1920s. A race to build the tallest and fastest coaster grabbedheadlines, while innovation led to a new generation of looping roller coasters.

In the end, 341 booths were rented, 89 more than in the previous year. A ballroom was even pressed into service as annex space.
