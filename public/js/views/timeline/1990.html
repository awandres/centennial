    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-top:-34px; color:#696969;">The industry evolved on many levels during the 1990s. The opening of Disneyland Paris in France led to a wave of new development throughout Europe. A new roller coaster arms race, launched at the end of the 1980s, was a global phenomenon throughout the decade as larger and larger rides were built and new genres such as the inverted coaster created new thrills for riders all over the world. With consumers increasingly pressed for time, family entertainment centers came into their own by offering a limited number of attractions that could be enjoyed in a few hours.</p><p class="indent-p"> But likely the most transformative event of the 1990s was the investment banker-driven consolidation wave that spread throughout the world. Premier Parks led the surge, acquiring family-owned facilities, injecting new life into their purchases with heavy investment. Premier’s growth culminated in its acquisition of Six Flags in 1998 and eventual expansion into Europe. Other companies followed suit, and by the end of the decade many family-owned parks were operating under corporate umbrellas.
