    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-top:-34px; color:#696969;">By many accounts, the amusement industry entered its first Golden Age in the 1920s. With increasing prosperity, business grew to record levels, technology made ever more thrilling rides possible, and the large, city-based, family-owned amusement park emerged as the heart of this growing industry. Roller coasters emerged as the king of the park, with drops and twists that were unimaginable just a few years before. The emergence of the automobile impacted the industry, closing dozens of parks that lacked accessibility androom for parking lots and were replaced by newer, more modern amusement parks. Swimming pools became a popular attraction at dozens of amusement parks

        <p class="indent-p">
        At its annual meeting in Chicago a month later, NOSA dissolved, and the National Association of Amusement Parks (NAAP) was formed.Andrew S. McSwigan of Kennywood was named the organization’s president and Alfred R. Hodge of Riverview Amusement Park in Chicago appointed secretary. Forty people attended the first meeting, which offered eight educational sessions including publicity, picnics, reducing liability insurance, and yes, taxes.

        <p class="" style="color:#696969; font-size:14px;"><strong>1921 |</strong>  The imposition of Blue Laws, forcing businesses to close on Sunday, was a major topic at the second annual meeting in February.The growth of the association was evident. Membership had doubled, attendance increased from 40 to 150, 20 educational sessions were presented, and manufacturers were invited to display their latest inventions. “We will not stop until we drive out the bad concessionaire and every other objectionable feature from our parks. We will fight the Blue Law agitation and offer all encouragement to the inventors of new and good park devices,” said McSwigan.
        </p>
        <p class="indent-p">
        The annual meeting was moved to December in response to manufacturers seeking to reach a greater number of showmen. The first formal trade show was held with 42 exhibitors. The fight against Blue Laws continued. “We believe that if a rich man can ride his horse on Sunday, a poor man should have the same right to ride on a merry-go-round horse,” said Billboard magazine.

        In his annual address, McSwigan stated: “An amusement park is a legitimate agency of public recreation and a large factor in the peace and happiness of its public. All unclean things in amusement parks must positively be wiped out. This is one of our aims.”

Uzzell and best practices for the inspection of roller coasters and other amusement rides. The first participants from outside the United States (from Canada) attended, and President McSwigan spoke of his vision for a “convention in a large hall” along with “a vast exposition consisting of several hundreds of [booths] where the latest devices and park goods would be exhibited.” His dream would take 50 years to be realized.
