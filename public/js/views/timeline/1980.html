    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-top:-34px; color:#696969;">As the 1980s dawned, the industry in North America was maturing. The opening of Canada’s Wonderland outside Toronto, Canada, in 1981 signaled the end of the theme park boom—the result of increasing costs and market saturation. Similar factors also ended the rollercoaster arms race with the completion of the “American Eagle” at Marriott’s Great America, north of Chicago. Instead, it was the decade of water attractions. New innovations like river rapids and “spillwater” rides using giant, multipassenger boats became industry staples, while the nascent water park industry spread throughout the United States. In 1982, Carowinds, uniquely positioned on the border of North and South Carolina, opened the “Ocean Island” wave pool. For an additional $3, guests could enter the water park. In 1983, Geauga Lake in Aurora, Ohio, became the first park to offer both a water park and amusement park for one single admission price, now an industry staple. Technology also began to play a greater role, with simulator attractions becoming popular.
    </p><p class="indent-p"> Globally, the industry began to spread. Tokyo Disneyland opened to huge crowds, signaling the arrival of American-style theme parks in international markets and driving the globalization of the industry. Other developers attempted to bring modern theme parks to China and India with mixed success, while the industry in Europe grew in scale and sophistication.

They visited a dozen attractions and attended Amusement Expo ’86 in Beijing, the first trade show in the emerging market. The delegation recognized Dong Fang Amusement Park in Guangzhou as China’s first IAAPA member.</p><p class="indent-p"> IAAPA contracted with the U.S. Travel Data Center to conduct a survey on amusement park visitation patterns. According to the study, an estimated 235 million Americans planned to visit an amusement park during 1986, 15 percent more than the previous year.It also revealed 53 percent of Americans planned to visit amusement parks an average of 1.9 times, while one-fourth of all vacation trips will include a visit to an amusement park.</p><p class="indent-p">The first IAAPA Strategic Planning Committee was formed. Chaired by Michael Jenkins with Leisure and Recreation Concepts, the committee recommended an increase in educational training programs, particularly with regional seminars.  The committee also prioritized increased international representation in the organization, leading to the establishment of the International Council. The council, comprising park associations from outside the United States, could appoint two voting members to the IAAPA board.
        </p><p class="indent-p"> IAAPA also created the Allied Council to give exhibitors a voice in the organization. Comprising allied industry groups such as the American Recreational Equipment Association (AREA), the International Association of Fairs and Expositions (IAFE), the Showmen’s League of America (SLA), and the World Waterpark Association (WWA), the council was able to appoint a member to the IAAPA Advisory Board. Today, the IAAPA Advisory Board is made up of all the former living chairmen.</p><p class="indent-p">A captive insurance company sanctioned by IAAPA called “Attractions Insurance Co.” began addressing problems with availability and cost of insurance.</p><p class="indent-p">The trade show was held in Orlando for the first time at the Orange County Convention and Civic Center. Registration was a record 13,591. Demand for space among the 501 exhibitors meant 40 percent of the companies had to be housed in tents. The convention also featured the first Thursday night social at an attraction—“An Evening at SeaWorld”—and the debut of the IAAPA Brass Ring Awards, which recognized creativity and excellence in marketing and advertising.

IAAPA focused on affiliating with foreign associations, including those in Germany, Mexico, South America, and Japan, and sent a delegation to Brazil to attend the inaugural meeting of ADIBRA (the Brazilian Association of Amusement Parks). During the convention, workshops were translated into Spanish, French, German, and Japanese, while a delegation from the Soviet Union attended the convention. Several Soviet attendees joined, bringing the number of member countries in IAAPA to 51. Membership surpassed 2,000 for the first time, driven by a 35 percent jump in international membership.</p><p class="indent-p">The first managers and owners luncheon was held at the convention, with Jay Stein of Universal Studios as keynote speaker.
