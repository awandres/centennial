    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-top:-34px; color:#696969;">As IAAPA celebrates its centennial, the association is part of the attractions industry's rich global legacy stretching back more than 500 years. The industry’s roots come from the pleasure gardens that spread throughout European cities from the 1500s to the early 1800s. They provided a place to escape teeming cities and featured many attractions familiar to us today, including landscaped gardens, live entertainment, fireworks, dancing, games, and even predecessors to the merry-go-round, roller coaster, and Ferris wheel. This legacy remains in places like Bakken, outside Copenhagen, Denmark, which opened in 1583, and the Prater in Vienna, which dates back to 1766; Mack Rides, meanwhile, started manufacturing show wagons in 1780.

      <br><br>
    Pleasure gardens migrated to North America in the late 1700s, but it was not until the latter half of the 1800s that amusement parks began to truly emerge as their own industry. In the years following the American Civil War, transportation companies began developing pleasure resorts to generate traffic. The trolley park was born with the development of the first successful electric street railway, and amusement parks spread rapidly through the United States. Seaside resorts offering more extended getaways opened throughout the United States and England. Chicago’s World’s Columbian Exposition in 1893 and the emergence of Coney Island in New York as the center of the amusement park universe brought global attention to this emerging sector. With new parks opening worldwide at a rapid clip, companies began forming to supply equipment to these new operations. It was obvious a new industry was emerging, and its members needed to speak with one voice

        <p class="first" style="color:#696969; font-size:14px;"><strong>1907 | </strong>In September, an article appeared in Street Railway Journal proposing the start of an organization of the owners of “open-air amusement interests in North America.” The purpose would be to “advance mutual interests in securing information for the use of its members regarding construction of various devices, the booking of the best European and American attractions, and the discussion of best business methods in management."

        <p style="color:#696969; font-size:14px; text-indent:30px; margin-top:-10px;">
        An organizational meeting was held in October in New York City where the name, National Amusement Park Association, was adopted along with eight organizational principles. Many bear a strong resemblance to the priorities of today’s IAAPA, such as government relationsand sharing of effective business practices in areas like landscaping, crowd control, and employment. Other priorities, however, reflected adifferent era—coordinated booking of live entertainment, the association’s top priority, and ensuring each facility contained a “woman’s building, where women and children may be cared for, and where, if necessary, a trained nurse may be provided.” The first general meeting was held Nov. 14. Among the officers was Andrew McSwigan of Kennywood, who would go on to help found IAAPA a decade later. A newly formed statistics committee sent a 40-question survey to all members. Permanent offices were established in New York City.

        <p style="color:#696969; font-size:14px;"><strong>1908 | </strong>The organization’s second annual meeting took place in September where the members voted to eliminate the initiation fee and reduce the annual dues. The National Amusement Park Association quietly disbanded not long after. It was obviously an organization ahead of its time as the industry was still too wedded to the transportation companies that were so critical to the initial growth.
