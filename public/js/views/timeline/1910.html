    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-top:-34px; color:#696969;">By the 1910s, the amusement industry had matured. Transportation companies, which looked at amusement parks as a sideline, wereexiting the business, and a new generation of entrepreneurs was acquiring the facilities as its primary business. As consumer demandand technology continued to evolve, the focus of amusement parks shifted from passive attractions such as concerts and dancing to amusement rides, and amusement parks began taking on the identity we know today. With businesspeople now running amusement parks as their primary source of income, they came to the common realization that there were looming threats to their operations andthey needed to speak with one voice, set standards for high-quality operations, and share operational ideas

        <p class="first" style="color:#696969; font-size:14px;"><strong>1916 |</strong> More than 600 outdoor showmen from North America and Europe gathered at New York’s Hotel Astor in December, where the call was put out to organize like most other industries to present a unified front and protect their interests. The group adopted the name Association of Outdoor Showmen of the World.

        <p style="color:#696969; font-size:14px;"><strong>1917  |</strong>  The showmen reassembled in Chicago in February to formalize the organization, adopting the name National Outdoor Showmen’s Association (NOSA). Termed a “protective association,” key constituent groups included circuses, carnivals, agents, fairs, showboats, amusement parks, aviation and racing shows, and tent shows. NOSA quickly demonstrated its value the next month when it was able to present a unified front and defeat a proposed amusement tax in Missouri.

        Proposed restrictions during World War I, including the elimination of traveling shows as non-essential to the war effort along with proposed limitations on manufactured goods, prompted a meeting of a Special War Emergencies Committee in December. “Clean amusements are just as necessary to the health of a nation as clothing or food,” said NOSA Secretary Frank Albert.

The result was the formation of a Park Division within the National Outdoor Showmen’s Association. This is recognized as the birth of whatwould become IAAPA.
