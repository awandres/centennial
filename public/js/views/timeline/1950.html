    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-top:-34px; color:#696969;">It was a decade of evolution for the attractions industry as it continued its global recovery from the hard times of the Great Depression and World War II. With the postwar baby boom and growth of suburbia in the United States, kiddielands (the forebear of the modern family entertainment center) began springing up near another postwar phenomenon: the shopping center. Growing from fewer than two dozen in 1950 to more than 150 operating throughout the country by 1960, most kiddielands succumbed to rising property values and changing tastes by the 1970s. Meanwhile, another new type of attraction—theme parks—began their evolution from roadside attractions into global destinations like Disneyland, which opened in 1955. In Europe, the industry rebounded from the war with new levels of sophistication not yet seen in North America.

It failed to reach an affiliation agreement with NAAPPB, which responded by creating a new membership classification for kiddielands. The Kiddieland Operators Association was short-lived, however, as NAAPPB soon integrated kiddielands as a constituent group.</p><p class="indent-p"> While trade show attendance was down 20 percent, concerns about the worsening situation with the Korean War led to brisk purchasing on the trade show floor among the 81 exhibitors.

Mangels, it is the first published history of the attractions industry.</p><p class="indent-p">A convention session on the growing impact of television concluded that while it was an excellent advertising medium, it had no place as an attraction at an amusement park.</p><p class="indent-p">A seven-man legislative committee was formed to lead efforts to repeal the federal 20 percent excise tax on admissions, a longtime goal of the NAAPPB. The effort succeeded in 1954 with the virtual elimination of the levy. As a result of these efforts, the organization saw the need to re-establish a presence in Washington.

Another session featured C.V. Wood, general manager of Disneyland, reporting on the park’s first season, and hinted future attractions would include a Roto Jet, Dodgem, and mining-car ride.

The attendees found an industry that was remaking itself following World War II, with intricate flower beds, elaborate landscaping, innovative lighting, music, and flashy new rides adorned with thousands of electric lights. “Europe is far ahead of us on ideas for flashing rides and parks ... we definitely will have 1959 improvements that are a result of this trip,” said Carl Sinclair of Ohio’s Meyers Lake Park in a Billboard interview. While on the trip, Jimmy Johnson, owner of Playland Park in San Antonio, Texas, ordered the first Calypso ride to be imported into North America.
