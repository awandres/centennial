    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-top:-34px; color:#696969;">The Great Depression pressured the industry, and hundreds of amusement parks closed worldwide as discretionary income dried up. By 1939, Billboard reported fewer than 400 parks remained in operation in the U.S.—about half the number that existed three decades earlier. To survive, parks turned away from adding new rides and focused on promotions and live entertainment, particularly big band dances.

The Summer Meeting was canceled and would not resume until 1949.

        <p style="color:#696969; font-size:14px;"><strong>1934 |</strong>  As the tough times continued, NAAP worked hard to ensure the organization continued to grow and be relevant to its members. Spurred by a U.S. government National Recovery Act ruling, the NAAP merged with the American Association of Pools and Beaches (AAPB), expanding its constituency to the pool and beach industry, providing an important way of growing the association at a time when the membership base was dwindling. The merger was formalized at a meeting in November in Toronto.

        By this time, what was now the National Association of Amusement Parks, Pools, and Beaches (NAAPPB) had grown to the scope that Alfred Hodge, the publicity and advertising chief at Chicago’s Riverview Park, left his position of eight years, to devote his full-time attention to the association, thus becoming its first full-time employee.

In 1936, it launched a liability insurance plan for the industry that by 1942 was considered the best offered by any trade association in the country.
